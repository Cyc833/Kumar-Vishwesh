# ABOUT
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/krvishwesh54/kumar_vishwesh/main/images/profile.jpg)

I am Kumar Vishwesh, a seasoned data scientist with ~7 years of progressive experience in artificial intelligence. I have contributed as an AI product developer (R&D unit) and been AI consultant for top-notch clients in their AI journey. I am involved in comprehensive development, design & analysis of AI algorithms to build analytical solutions, while facilitating and leading data science teams.

As an AI mentor, I manage a website on AI (https://www.datasciencestunt.com) with a vision to edify budding data scientists. I have conducted a workshop on AI/ ML at the National Institute of Technology, delivered talk on ML at an event organized by CII and built AI capability within the teams at work.

# PROJECTS

#### Classification based projects

#### Regression based projects
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/krvishwesh54/kumar_vishwesh/main/images/Regression.jpg)

Regression is a supervised learning technique which helps in finding the correlation between variables and enables us to predict the continuous output variable based on the one or more predictor variables.

#### Clustering based projects
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/krvishwesh54/kumar_vishwesh/main/images/Clustering.jpg)

Cluster analysis, or clustering, is an unsupervised machine learning task. It involves automatically discovering natural grouping in data. Unlike supervised learning (like predictive modeling), clustering algorithms only interpret the input data and find natural groups or clusters in feature space.

#### Recommender system based projects
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/krvishwesh54/kumar_vishwesh/main/images/RS.jpeg)

Machine learning algorithms in recommender systems are typically classified into two categories â€” content based and collaborative filtering methods although modern recommenders combine both approaches. The task of machine learning is to learn a function that predicts utility of items to each user.
